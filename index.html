<!--Hello, maker! Welcome to my Electrate Fuego web design tutorial. I'm glad you found it – for this might be a real intersection on your way to becoming. I (S.J. Quigley) use this document in my Technical Communications classes at the University of Pittsburgh to teach my students a little bit about computer science and something called "electracy." Just follow along with comments like this one, and you'll make a really cool web documemt that not only introduces you to the other people in our classes, but will help you process how different discourse communities in your life have contributed to your arrival in this space, virtual and actual, and also contribute to where you might be going.
In this doc, you will work through Gregory Ulmer's discourses of career, family, entertainment, community, and schooling (_Internet Invention From Literacy to Electracy_, 2002.) In Ulmer's text, he elides community and schooling into one category, but for our puposes I have separated them. Ulmer's theory of electracy helps makes sense of how we find/construct meaning and connect with others rhetorically in a media rich ecology. Ulmer uses analogy to define electracy, explaining that "electracy is to digital media what literacy is to print."
You could make this document the easy way--like I once did by using a program called Adobe Spark: https://spark.adobe.com/page/umUY5ROHgANCl/, or you can do a little more work to unconceal, opening up these tools that you use every day, but might not know how they function, yet prove so necessary to how you (re)present yourself and connect with others in virtual spaces. And this last bit is an important point! If we really want to be makers, if we really want to be creative, then we need to understand what our digital tools do, how they work, and consider the implications of their use. Through this process you will alos learn a little bit about computer literacy and computer science. Enough to allow you to build web texts and understand file management.
So let's cut this thing open – using "tmesis" as the Ancient Greeks would call it – lets "cut" and arrange, tweak, take away and augment...that's how we create! I hope you're excited to use this tool to create a document that will simultaneously help you process your journey and help orient you along the path on which you are headed in your becoming. Before we get going I would like to give a shout-out to my research buddy Shauna Chung, who helped me develop the original Ulmerian framework we will be following in this document. Are you ready to get started?-->

 <!--To get started, you will need to fork my repository from GitHub if you haven't already. If you want to easily publish it on GitHub, I'll give you more information at the end of this document. But for right now, fork, and then download the website to a zip file (or clone it, if you know what that means). Go ahead and put these files in a secure place (folder) where you will be able to find them and organize your other assests like images, pdfs, etcetera. You will also need a text editor like "brackets.io" or "atom.io" or "notepad-plus-plus.org." Open the style.css and index.html documents in the text editor and we can get started building our own electrate experience.-->

<!--BTW. You can leave these hidden HTML text fields be, or delete them. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

<!--First we will need to do some work in the head of the document. The head organizes important information needed to expalin to browsers how the website will work. Go ahead and change the title of this HTML document below, from "Electrate Fuego" to whatever you want it to be called. Your new text will appear in your browser tab-->

<title>Esther Lui</title>

    <!--this next section of code does important work to help different browsers understand what this page should look like on the different kinds of screens.-->

<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

     <!--this code tells the browser to link to the style.css file that controls the appearance of much of your content.-->

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
</head>


<!--The body of the document houses the content that a user usually sees on a website. We'll be spending most of our time in this section.-->

<body>

<!-- We'll need to do some more work in this section, but to do so, we'll need to make some changes on your style.css file. Developers refer to this division as a "Hero Block," but we will refer to it as a "Wide Image."  Think carefully about the image you select and how it might serve a sybolic function in your life. Ulmer refers to these kinds of symbolic images as "wide images" in that they often repeat over and over in our lifetime. We will similarly repeat this image at the end of your Electrate Infuego composition to establish a motif in this web document.
Place a .jpg or .png in the same file folder as this project (hint: simplify the name). You don't need to do anything on this html page, but you'll need to change the background image name on the style.css page to match you image asset.
Now, change the other relevant information in this section, especially if you're not John en Fuego or not majoring in "electracy"-->

      <!--In our first exploration of discourse, we're going to think about the wider characteristics or themes of our field or future career. In academia, we do a lot of work narrowing our interest to arrive at a career or profession, often reducing our field to a level of operation or an act. Instead, I would like you to think more broadly about the "wider themes" you associate with your field or future career and its larger significance in improving our world. Yes--improving the world. Thinking back, where do you see exposure to those same "wider themes" in your own life? Those ah-ha moments, lessons, examples, tools, passions, or qualities that suggested this career path to you? Replace the content between <h2> and </h2> that begins with "Lorem ipsum."-->

     <div class="par-centertext">
  <h1>Field or Career</h1>

  <h2>I started college wanting to pursue a pre-Physician Assistant (PA) track, with a degree in history. In 2019, I studied in Taiwan for a semester. Currently, I study Public and Professional Writing and Chinese, with a minor in Korean and certificate in Asian Studies. </h2>

<!--We will begin this section with a photo grid. Add those beautiful, meaningful "family" and "home" photos (only you can define family) to your project folder, making sure the files end in .jpg or .png and replace/add the names of your assets to the grid below. You can add more photos if you wish, or subtract... see what happens – you have to be playful to find the purpose of things. You may need to adjust the size of your assets to produce the effect you desire. Resizing local files is one way to control the size of images on a website.-->

I'll let you explain. -->

  <h2>When I have time, I like to write calligraphy, make hand-made gifts, and send snail mail to friends and family. I connect a lot with people who share similarly quirky interests. To me language also plays a key role in defining my communities. I speak six languages, but really only four of them with any degree of fluency. More recently, working as an interpreter and translator for Mandarin/Cantonese, I’ve been able to meet all kinds of people, all with fascinating stories to tell. This especially has broadened my sense of community. </h2>

  <h2>Like I mention above, I’m currently studying in two different fields: Chinese and professional writing, with a surprising amount of overlap between the two. This comes in terms of research and writing processes. In the Chinese department, I research how Chinese scholars in the 1980s and 1990s shift their perceptions and narrative of China. I approach this through a distant reading of a controversial Chinese documentary from 1988 called River Elegy. 
  	<br><br>In terms of professional writing, the PPW program has afforded me opportunity to dabble in a lot of different fields within professional writing. Of these, I would situate myself in the technical writing and design field. </h2></h2>

   <li><h2>It started with Don Norman, but my interest really set off with my inovlvement in designing the WALI Community Toolkit and the related Health Literacy training course.</h2></li>
   <li><h2>My role: research, design, writing (what kind of content are relevant, how to deliver this content).
